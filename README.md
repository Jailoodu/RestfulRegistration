### Built With

* [Python]()
* [Flask]()
* [Docker]()
* [Google Firestore]()


<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

In order to run the project, you will need Docker installed.
* Docker
  ```sh
  Instructions: https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/
  ```

### Installation

1. Clone the repo.
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Jailoodu/RestfulRegistration.git
   ```
2. Create a file in the root directory called `serviceAccount.json` by following the steps at https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/creating-managing-service-account-keys.

3. Create a docker image for the project.
   ```sh
   docker build -t python-register:latest . 
   ```
   
4. Run the docker image that was created.
   ```sh
   docker run -d -p 5001:5001 python-register 
   ```

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

This project is built upon RESTful architecture, therefore it is ideal if one is familiar with it. The following steps assume that you are running this application locally with the default settings. You can utilize CURL or an application like Postman to submit requests.

1. Ensure the project is running.
   ```sh
   docker ps
   ```

2. Head over to http://127.0.0.1:5001/api/, where the Swagger UI is hosted. You will be able to view API definitions and examples of all the available endpoints.

## Testing

[Pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/) was utilized to test this repository. The unit tests can be found in `./tests/test_implementation.py`, the acceptance tests in `./tests/test_app.py`, and the stress tests in `./tests/test_stress.py`. 

To run the tests locally, the serviceAccount.json.enc file needs to be decrypted, please message the developers to request the decryption command. Then run the command `pytest --cov=api tests`. A coverage report will be generated within `./docs/coverage.html` once the tests are completed.

Travis CI is being utilized to automate testing, you can find the instance [here](https://travis-ci.org/github/Jailoodu/RestfulRegistration). 

For the Professor and TAs of 4ZP6: you've been given permission to this GitHub repository, therefore if you log into travis-ci.org, you will see the builds for this project, and be able to start a new one to run the tests. 

A static copy of the coverage report is located at `./docs/coverage.png`.
